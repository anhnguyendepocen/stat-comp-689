    "** Exercise: ** We computed bigram counts from \"War and Peace.\" More generally one could compute [ngrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). Try finding all 3 grams and calculating the conditional problability of any letter given the last two letters. So P(hello) = $P(h)P(e|h)P(l|he)P(l|el)P(o|ll)$.\n",

    "** Exercise: ** Write a \"random word generator.\" Here the input to the function is a character sequence length $n$ and the output is a random text sequence drawn from a 1,2,or 3 gram distribution. Random sequences from 3 gram distributions should produce character strings with many real words.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Exercise: ** We are really more focused on the mode of the posterior than the full posterior distribution. Since the prior is flat, the mode of the posterior is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. Simulated tempering (Section 26.6 of Lange) is one method for finding the MLE / posterior mode for multimodal models. It shares many similarities with Metropolis. Implement simulated annealing for this problem. Does you algorithm converge more often to the correct solution than Metropolis?"
